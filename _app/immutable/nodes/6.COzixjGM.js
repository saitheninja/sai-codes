    </a>. Knowing my messages eventually get deleted relieves some of my posting
    anxiety. Especially when I ask something obvious or dumb - that stuff is
    just clutter. (Also memes go stale incredibly quickly). Discord vs forums is
    like texting vs email.</p> <p>Also, the internet is rotting and those forums aren&#39;t immune. Especially the
    images, which usually had to be hosted on a different service and therefore
    are long gone.</p> <p>I&#39;ve definitely found value in decades old forum threads, however I also
    find value in all the shiny features that Discord has. I&#39;ll make the trade
    for emoji reactions.</p> <p>I think most humans find synchronous communication to be easier. Instant
    messaging has always had a widespread appeal that posting on forums has not.
    Having the instant feedback makes communication easier.</p>`;return{c(){e=m("h1"),e.textContent=r,a=y(),s=m("div"),s.innerHTML=h,this.h()},l(t){e=c(t,"H1",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(e)!=="svelte-m9y628"&&(e.textContent=r),a=b(t),s=c(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),d(s)!=="svelte-iuh3yl"&&(s.innerHTML=h),this.h()},h(){u(e,"class","heading-size-1 mb-10 leading-tight"),u(s,"class","space-y-4")},m(t,n){o(t,e,n),o(t,a,n),o(t,s,n)},p:i,i,o:i,d(t){t&&(l(e),l(a),l(s))}}}class _ extends g{constructor(e){super(),v(this,e,null,w,p,{})}}export{_ as component};
