    Knowing my messages eventually get deleted relieves some of my posting anxiety.
    Especially when I ask something obvious or dumb - that stuff is just clutter.
    (Also memes go stale incredibly quickly). Discord vs forums is like texting vs
    email.

    Also, the internet is rotting and those forums aren't immune. Especially the
    images, which usually had to be hosted on a different service and therefore
    are long gone.

    I've definitely found value in decades old forum threads, however I also
    find value in all the shiny features that Discord has. I'll make the trade
    for emoji reactions.

    I think most humans find synchronous communication to be easier. Instant
    messaging has always had a widespread appeal that posting on forums has not.
    Having the instant feedback makes communication easier.
