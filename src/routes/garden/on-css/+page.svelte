    "pixel perfect" is dumb. Web pages are stretchy. Use min and max, and let
    the browser work it out.
  </p>

  <p>Margins collapse. Padding adds.</p>

  <p>
    Container queries are swag af. They allow you to tune layouts more finely
    than before.

  <h2 class="pt-4">Tailwind Specific</h2>

  <p>
    It's fast to play with designs, and you know you aren't fucking up the rest
    of the site by changing global CSS. Just doing combinations of static
    utility classes.
  </p>

  <p>Tailwind sets useful media queries.</p>

  <p>
    Design all layouts for a component at the same time, from smallest screen to
    biggest screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Build everything in one page and then abstract into components once the
    patterns become obvious.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use margin for fine-tuning specific content, like text or logos. First use
    `gap`, `space-x`, etc.
  </p>

  <p>`@apply` to use Tailwind classes in css files.</p>

  <p>New coloured shadows are cool.</p>
