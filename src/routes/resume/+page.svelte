  <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

  <section id="letter-intro">
    <p>
      I am applying for the Web Developer role at Canonical. I have been
      developing websites professionally for 5 years, and most importantly, I
      believe in the mission of great open source.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="letter-body-1">
    <p>
      I am neurodivergent, so I know what it's like to need some help. Also, I
      have volunteered at many philanthropic organisations in life, so I know
      what it means to help people. Blockchain and AI companies aren't helping
      people. Ubuntu and Canonical are helping people. Specifically they have
      helped me.
    </p>

    <p>
      In 2002 the Shuttleworth Foundation launched an educational TV show called
      <a

      </a>
      (Hip to be Square), which I used to watch religiously. In 2004 I was 10 years
      old when I won a subscription to Popular Mechanics Magazine from the show.
      In high school I couldn't afford Photoshop so I used GIMP for my school projects.
      In 2015 I started working as a photographer full-time, and using Darktable
      and DaVinci Resolve meant that I didn't have to get scammed by Adobe's subscription
      model. In 2018 I started running Ubuntu servers in production, and switched
      to using Linux full-time on my main machine. Mark Shuttleworth and open source
      have been helping me out for more than 20 years. Now that I have built up

      >
        the skills
      </a>, I want to contribute back to Ubuntu.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="letter-body-3">
    <p>
      I have experience working with most relevant technologies, and I will
      gladly learn any tech needed for the job. I have at least some familiarity
      with:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>
        languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Flutter, Elm, Gleam.
      </li>
      <li>frameworks: Svelte, Vue, React, Angular.</li>
      <li>runtimes: Node, Deno, Bun.</li>
      <li>formatting and linting tools: Prettier, ESLint, Stylelint, Biome.</li>
      <li>testing tools: Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress.</li>
      <li>deployment tools: Docker, Docker Compose, Nix.</li>
      <li>browsers: Chrome (and Chromium), Firefox, Safari.</li>
      <li>code editors: (Neo)Vim, VSCode (and VSCodium), Emacs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I also love talking about the intricacies of the Linux desktop. There's so
      many parts to choose from, like:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Desktop environments: Plasma, GNOME XFCE, Cosmic.</li>
      <li>
        Window managers: i3wm, Sway, awesomewm, Hyprland, and so many more.
      </li>
      <li>Windows: floating, tiling, dynamic.</li>
      <li>Backend systems: ALSA vs Pipewire, X vs Wayland.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I also like to mess around with hardware when I can afford it. It's
      another area with a lot of choices to make. Choices like:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>Form factors: laptop, desktop, NUC, server rack.</li>
      <li>Hardware vendors: Apple, Framework, Tux.</li>
      <li>CPU architectures: x86, ARM, RISC-V.</li>
      <li>Embedded devices: Arduino, Raspberry Pi.</li>
      <li>
        Peripherals: split keyboards, mechanical switches (that's another
        rabbithole), horizontal and vertical mice, adaptive controllers, MIDI
        devices.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      But I'm not just interested in technology. Technology is made and used by
      people. Therefore I am interested in the governace and sustainability of
      projects. There are important questions that must be answered, like:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
      <li>
        How much transparency should strangers on the internet have into the
        process?
      </li>
      <li>
        Should the project be run by a Benevolent Dictator For Life or a
        non-profit foundation?
      </li>
      <li>
        How to balance the classic open source dilemma of doing what you love
        for free versus needing money to live?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section
    id="letter-outro"
    class="mb-2"
  >
    <p>
      I hope it is now evident that I am a huge nerd for open source. I would
      greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute back to the projects that
      have helped me, and contribute to the mission of great open source in any
      way that I can.
